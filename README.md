# Frame-based Animal Kingdom

A python script with 4 classes that implements the concept of a Frame-based System.

Demonstrates multiple and one-to-one inheritance of 'slots'.

These slots mainly refer to the attributes and functions that substantiate a frame (an instance of an object).

A frame is in practice an instance of an object in OOP when implemented.
